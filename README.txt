PLAYING THE GAME
==============================

------------------------------
Getting Started
------------------------------
* This game is a simplified form of baseball intended for 2 players who are sharing a single device
* The game lasts for 3 complete innings, each with a top and bottom half, consisting of 3 outs each
* Each half inning, it is recommended that the players switch the person controlling the device, so they may represent their team on offense
* The Away team is at bat first (top of the inning), followed by the Home team (bottom of the inning)
* Once a new game is initiated, the scoreboard will display the message PLAY BALL!
* Press the space key to send out the first pitch

------------------------------
Pitching
------------------------------
* Press the space key to initate a pitch
* After a randomized delay, the ball will appear on screen and move towards home plate with a randomized speed and path
* At this point, a player may press the space key to swing at the ball
* For the best result, the player should swing just as the ball passes over home plate
* If the player swings too early or too late, a strike will be recorded
* If the player does not swing at all, the pitch may result in a strike or a ball
* It is possible to strike out or walk

------------------------------
Hitting
------------------------------
* If the player successfully makes contact with the ball, a randomized result will be generated based on the timing of the swing
* Possible results include a single hit, double hit, triple hit, homerun, and flyout
* Immediately after recording a successful hit, the scoreboard will display the result, corresponding audio tones will be played, and a ball icon will appear on the field to show its approximate landing point
* At this point, the player may run the bases by holding down the space key

------------------------------
Running
------------------------------
* Hold down the space key to advance all runners along the bases
* Release the space key to stop all runners
* Each batter has a randomized speed and all runners proceed at the speed of the current batter
* There is a limited timeframe in which runners may advance
* To avoid being thrown out, ensure that all runners land safely on a base before the defense fields the ball

------------------------------
Defense
------------------------------
* Defense is automated
* Depending on the result of a given hit, a randomized timeframe that represents how long the defense takes to field the ball will determine how long runners have to advance
* Note that for single, double, and triple hits, there is no guarantee that the batter will reach a given base
* Instead, the player must assess the speed of the runners and the quality of the hit to determine how far the runners may safely advance without being caught off base
* If all runners end safely on base when the ball is fielded, play proceeds to the next batter
* However, if the runners are between bases when the ball is fielded, there are several possible results:
** If the batter fails to reach first base, the batter will be out
** If the batter passes first base, the lead runner will be out
** Meanwhile, any remaining runners will either advance or retreat to the nearest base

------------------------------
Continuing Play
------------------------------
* A brief delay follows the resolution of each play to allow the players to observe the current status of play
* Once the ball icon disappears from the field, play may resume, most often by pressing the space key to send out the next pitch
* The scoreboard displays the latest result and overall status of the game, so it may be further used as an indication of the current state of play

------------------------------
Ending Play
------------------------------
* Once the game is complete, the scoreboard will display the message GAME OVER
* Pressing the space key will completely reset the game, so it may be played again

==============================
Audio Notes
==============================
* A few basic sound effects are included in the game
* The sound effects provide audio cues relevant to the in-game action and can improve player performance
* However, the sound effects also duplicate text information that is provided in the scoreboard
* Therefore, the game need not be played with the devices speaker volume on
* There is no option to mute the audio using in-game controls
